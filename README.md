# Breast Cancer Classification Using Neural Networks

## Overview

This project implements a neural network model to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign. It utilizes the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from scikit-learn.

## Model Development

1. *Data Processing:* Loaded dataset, checked for missing values, and examined statistical measures.
2. *Feature Separation:* Split dataset into features (X) and target (Y).
3. *Data Splitting:* Split data into training and testing sets.
4. *Data Standardization:* Standardized data for uniform scaling.
5. *Neural Network Construction:* Defined and compiled a neural network model.
6. *Model Training:* Trained the model on the training data.
7. *Training Results:* Printed training and validation accuracy for each epoch.

## Usage

Upload the provided Jupyter Notebook to Google Colab and execute code cells to run the model.
